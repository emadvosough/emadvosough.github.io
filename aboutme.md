Hi! I'm Emad Vosoughi, a computer engineering graduate from Iran University of Science and Technology. I specialize in game development, with a strong focus on Unity and C#. Over the past few years, I’ve been combining academic research with real-world projects—especially in the mobile gaming space. I’ve worked on titles like Emma’s Mansion and Go Ludo, and I even turned my bachelor’s thesis on fuzzy systems and game difficulty into a published paper.

In addition to development, I’ve spent a lot of time teaching what I love. At Medrick Academy, I led a three-month Unity course that helped many students kickstart their own careers in game development. Whether I’m programming, teaching, or experimenting with game mechanics, I enjoy solving problems and making interactive experiences more engaging.
